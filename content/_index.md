Hi! I'm Duncan Malashock. I write software and music, and I'm currently working full-time as an Engineering Manager at Vendr.
I've been writing in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) professionally since 2016.

In the past six years prior, I've worked on teams writing Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. And while engineering is filled with fun puzzles to solve, I also love the right-brained, visual work of collaborating with designers to realize their ideas.
