[Elm](https://twitter.com/elmlang) is easy to learn. But depending on your prior language experience, it can be hard to adapt to!

Want a better grasp on how to make the most of Elm? These 5 videos can help bridge the gap:

[Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman) demonstrates the strength of Elm's type system, showing how it allows you to model your data precisely.

Invalid states you might encounter in other languages can be made unrepresentable.

[Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman) discusses narrowing function signatures to organize code, reduce cognitive load, and make debugging easier.

He also explains the mistake of misapplying object-oriented “parent-child communication”.

### 🏅 What is Success? - Evan Czaplicki
