Every Monday, I approve and merge an auto-generated PR that removes all unused code in our 223k LOC front-end application.

If you use [Elm](https://twitter.com/elmlang), you can do this too! Here's how:

### üìÇ Install and init `elm-review` in your project

elm-review ([https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review](https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review)) by [Jeroen Engels](https://twitter.com/jfmengels) is a static analysis tool.

It allows you to define rules to apply to your source code, and tells you which parts don't follow them.

It can also fix problems automatically!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Set up an `elm-review` config

In the new `review` folder, set up your `ReviewConfig.elm` file.

Here's an example that removes all unused functions and types except for those in the `DontScanMe` directory:

Run `npx elm-review` to make sure it works!

### üìÑ Create a YAML configuration for a GitHub Action

Using GitHub Actions allows PRs to be created automatically on a schedule.

Here's an example config:

[https://gist.github.com/duncanmalashock/8d92c2e618abd606e14b51a24cbdbd19](https://gist.github.com/duncanmalashock/8d92c2e618abd606e14b51a24cbdbd19)

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Commit your changes and push to GitHub

That's it! At the time you specified in the YAML file, you'll see a PR that removes your project's unused code.

Thanks to [Jeroen Engels](https://twitter.com/jfmengels) for `elm-review`, a great tool for maintaining your codebase! ‚ù§Ô∏è
