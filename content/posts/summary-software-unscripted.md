Really enjoyed the latest episode of [Software Unscripted](https://twitter.com/sw_unscripted)!

[Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman) spoke with [Anjana Vakil](https://twitter.com/AnjanaVakil) about teaching functional programming.

Here are my takeaways:

### ‚ùì What is functional programming?

Definitions of FP vary! Some older definitions require point-free style. Others focus on the broader use of pure functions.

Anjana helpfully defines a goal of FP as moving side effects to the boundary of your program.

### üîß FP is one tool, not the only tool

FP has its enthusiasts in the programming community.

But you don't have to be dogmatic about FP as a "superior" way of doing programming. Not all code needs to be converted to functional style in all languages in order to be more effective.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ You don't have to be an expert to teach FP

Anjana describes a popular Unconference talk she gave in 2016 on FP as a beginner, that resonated with a huge number of people (2.3 million views on YouTube).

So people can be very receptive to relatable lessons from a beginner!

### üß† Question teaching FP "foundations"

Academic concepts like monads and the lambda calculus don't necessarily help students grasp FP.

Teaching these ideas as a rite of passage is not necessarily effective.

Anjana starts by helping students identify pure vs. impure functions.
