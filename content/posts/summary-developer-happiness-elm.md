Interested in [Elm](https://twitter.com/elmlang) coming from a dynamic language?

You could hardly ask for a better introduction than [Kevin Yank](https://twitter.com/sentience) gives in his video ["Developer Happiness on the Front End with Elm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOCx0QeQ5c).

Here's my synopsis:

### ü§î Reasons for choosing Elm

Kevin gives the context in which his team at [Culture Amp](https://twitter.com/CultureAmp) decided to use Elm with their Rails backend.

Elm aligns with Ruby's value of developer happiness, and doesn't suffer from the same issues with backwards compatibility as JS.

### üèõ Overview of Elm's design

Kevin gives a clear explanation of:

- The structure of an Elm program
- Elm's friendly compiler errors and the educational material they include
- How type annotations improve the error message from the compiler

### ‚úÖ The benefits of static types

- Why not just auto-convert `Int` to `String`?
- How `undefined` errors can propagate into user interfaces
- Sources of undefined values can be hard to find
- How Elm has no `null`, and what it uses instead

### üå≥ Elm's radical simplicity

Compared to "JavaScript fatigue", Elm includes best-in-class tools for:

- Packages
- Build tools
- Frameworks
- Type checking
- Immutable data

And compared to other languages, Elm:

- Doesn't use obscure FP jargon
- Looks to remove features

Thanks [Kevin Yank](https://twitter.com/sentience) for a clear, well-structured and educational video on Elm! ‚ù§Ô∏è
