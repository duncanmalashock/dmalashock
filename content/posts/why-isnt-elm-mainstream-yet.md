[Elm](https://twitter.com/elmlang) changed front-end development with its intentional design and radical simplicity.

A few years later, [Evan Czaplicki](https://twitter.com/evancz) encouraged the Elm community: "Let's be mainstream!", with a plan to do so.

After 10 years, Elm's rate of adoption is still quite low. Why is this?

In his talk ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE)), Evan expanded on several areas of his proposed strategy for promoting adoption, that he called "User-focused Design in Elm".

The two I want to focus on are Communication and Tooling.

### ðŸ—£ Communication

Evan asked the audience to imagine themselves as a developer comparing the competing sales pitches of a set of language tools.

He demonstrated that communication with an audience needs to be centered on the needs of that audience, not the features of the tool.

### ðŸ”§ Tooling

Evan emphasized the importance of leveraging Elm's advantages to create "unique and delightful experiences".

By providing experiences like the time-travel debugger and friendly error messages, Elm could appeal to its audience and be adopted as a mainstream language.

I think Elm itself has done an extremely good job at achieving these design goals.

But I often wonder how the tooling and communication efforts in the Elm community could appeal better to JavaScript developers and their problems.

This is why I'm excited about [@rhg_dev](https://twitter.com/rhg_dev)'s [Elm Land](https://elm.land) framework project. He seems to be asking questions like:

- What obstacles do JS devs meet when they try Elm?
- What is unfamiliar or hard to do?
- How can we make delightful experiences?
- How can we make Elm easy to try?
